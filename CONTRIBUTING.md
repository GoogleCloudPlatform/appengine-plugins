Please follow the guidelines below before opening an issue or a PR:

1. Ensure the issue was not already reported.
2. Open a new issue if you are unable to find an existing issue addressing your problem. Make sure to include a title and clear description, as much relevant information as possible, and a code sample or an executable test case demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.
3. Discuss the priority and potential solutions with the maintainers in the issue. The maintainers would review the issue and add a label "Accepting Contributions" once the issue is ready for accepting contributions.
4. Open a PR only if the issue is labeled with "Accepting Contributions", ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Note that an open PR without an issues labeled with "Accepting Contributions" will not be accepted.

### Before you contribute
Before we can use your code, you must sign the
[Google Individual Contributor License Agreement]
(https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-individual)
(CLA), which you can do online. The CLA is necessary mainly because you own the
copyright to your changes, even after your contribution becomes part of our
codebase, so we need your permission to use and distribute your code. We also
need to be sure of various other thingsâ€”for instance that you'll tell us if you
know that your code infringes on other people's patents. You don't have to sign
the CLA until after you've submitted your code for review and a member has
approved it, but you must do it before we can put your code into our codebase.
Before you start working on a larger contribution, you should get in touch with
us first through the issue tracker with your idea so that we can help out and
possibly guide you. Coordinating up front makes it much easier to avoid
frustration later on.

### Code reviews
All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use Github pull requests for this purpose.

Before submitting a pull request, please make sure to:

- Identify an existing [issue](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/appengine-plugins-core/issues) to associate with
  your proposed change, or [file a new issue](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/appengine-plugins-core/issues/new).
- Describe any implementation plans in the issue and wait for a review from the repository maintainers.

### The small print
Contributions made by corporations are covered by a different agreement than
the one above, the
[Software Grant and Corporate Contributor License Agreement]
(https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-corporate).
